<h1 align="center" id="title">Stock Trend Prediction</h1>

<p id="description">A project for stock trend prediction using Python involves creating a program that can analyze historical data and make predictions about future stock prices. This project could use machine learning algorithms such as linear regression to create a model that can accurately predict stock trends. The model would be trained on past data and use it to make predictions about future stock prices. This project could also utilize data visualization techniques to present the results in an easy to understand format. Using pandas library to display the data &amp; compare it with the predicted values.</p>
